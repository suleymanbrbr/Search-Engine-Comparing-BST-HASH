# Search-Engine-Comparing-BST-HASH


## Brief Description
In this project, I will write a search engine and compare the performance of two different data structures: Binary Search Tree (BST) and Hash Table. You will preprocess the provided documents by inserting nodes for each unique word into both data structures. Track the document name and the frequency of each word.
